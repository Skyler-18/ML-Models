# 🔧 Machine Learning From Scratch

This repository contains end-to-end implementations of core Machine Learning algorithms written **from scratch using Python**, leveraging only NumPy and pandas. No high-level libraries like Scikit-learn were used — every line of logic is handcrafted for educational clarity and depth.

## 📘 Algorithms Implemented

- ✅ Linear Regression
- ✅ Multiple Linear Regression
- ✅ Logistic Regression
- ✅ Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- ✅ Gradient Descent Optimization
- ✅ Regularization (L1, L2)

## 💡 Why This Repo?

Understanding the internals of ML algorithms helps build strong intuition. This project goes beyond using libraries — it's about **mastering the fundamentals** of Machine Learning by rebuilding them step by step.
