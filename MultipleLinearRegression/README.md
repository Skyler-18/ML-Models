# **Multiple Linear Regression from Scratch**
### In this notebook, I implement a multiple linear regression model from scratch using Python. This project demonstrates the core concepts of linear regression with multiple features, including:
- Solving the normal equation ((XᵀX)⁻¹Xᵀy) for exact coefficient estimation.
- Comparing results with scikit-learn's LinearRegression for validation.
- Evaluating model performance using R² score.
